      <p>
        In July 2023, I participated in a summer exchange program in Sweden, where I enrolled in a <strong>Leadership and Organizational Behavior</strong> course alongside nearly 30 individuals from 12 different countries.
      </p>
      <p>
        During the program, I actively engaged in various hands-on activities that allowed me to apply theoretical knowledge to real-world scenarios. One notable instance was a <strong>corporate role-playing</strong>, where we assumed different roles within a company to simulate complex <strong>decision-making processes</strong> and enhance our <strong>problem-solving skills</strong>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Being part of such a diverse class, I acquired valuable skills in <strong>interacting, communicating, and collaborating</strong> with people from vastly different cultures, and excelled in a group project on <strong><a className={sx.link} href={links.leadershipFigures} target="_blank" rel="noreferrer">Contemporary Leadership Figures</a></strong>.
